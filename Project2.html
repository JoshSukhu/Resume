      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>In this project, we worked on the cisco paket tracer software to simulate real world connections and setups. 
        This project's purpose was to create a router,<br>pc LAN setup in which every PC connected on the LAN would only be able
        to connect to eachother.<br>These devices were not allowed to connect to the internet, just to eachother, much like the setup
        of many office buildings.
